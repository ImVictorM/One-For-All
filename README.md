# One for All ‚öîÔ∏è

## Project Context üí°

A project used to practice some SQL concepts. In this project, I used a simple Spotify clone (`SpotifyClone-Non-NormalizedTable.xlsx`) table, non-normalized, where I had to normalize it and make an ER Diagram to build the database and its structure. Each query is in a file called `desafio{N}.sql` where "N" is the number of the requirement that the file represents. The file `desafio1.sql` represents the database structure, containing the creation and population of the databases' tables.

### Acquired Knowledge üìñ

In this project, I was able to:
- Use MySQL aggregation functions;
- Use MySQL conditionals;
- Work with date;
- Group and filter data using GROUP BY and HAVING;
- Combine data from tables using INNER JOIN, LEFT/RIGHT JOIN, and SELF JOIN;
- Make an ER Diagram;
- Normalize tables to the third normal form (3nf).
